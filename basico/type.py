'''
Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100


Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j
